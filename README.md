Make sure you are using python3.10 or up, or else pattern switching would not work

lister.py is the main

# Introduction
This program will help you list your movie ratings
The program includes the follow feature:
* Automatically removes the plan to watch list name if you write into watched list.
* Sort alphabetically by name, and highest/lowest rating
* Warns user if the rating is above 10

# To do:
* QT or pyQT GUI

# Inspiration 
I wanted a listing program that doesn't require the internet to track what I have been listing online, everything is saved locally.

I also wanted to work with data and files in python since it is easier than C.

# Disclaimer
I am still learning git, you will see some weird changes
Sorry if I program weirdly that cause you to commit sudoku (not sorry)
