Make sure you are using python3.10 or up, or else pattern switching would not work

lister.py is the main

# To do:
* If the key that is going to be added, check in plan-to-watch-list.json and remove the string.
* QT or pyQT GUI

# Inspiration 
I wanted a listing program that doesn't require the internet to track what I have been listing online, everything is saved locally.

I also wanted to work with data and files in python since it is easier than C.
