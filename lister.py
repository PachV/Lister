### This is a lister for movies(or databses like IMDb, MyAnimeList, VNDB, etc) you have watched and their rating. WIP
# To do list:
    # Add QT GUI and a image saving/scraping function(probably need to learn C++) 
    # Add plan-to watch list-
    #  plan-to watch list will be in another file (json) as a list datatype, if the user writes the key to the list.json that is
    #  already in the to plan-to watch list file, the list file's index (name) will be deleted

import read_algo as readalgo
import write_algo as writealgo
